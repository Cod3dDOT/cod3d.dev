## TODO

[ ] Middleware - csp "unsafe-hashes" can be mitigated if there is a way to set relative mouse position in a top-level script with a nonce for effects/spotlightCard.tsx.

[ ] Rewrite /scripts to use typescipt

[ ] Use vibrant colors for mons instead of the dominant color to improve contrast. Or investigate two colors per mon? That would increase the css filesize tho...
