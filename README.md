## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm start
pnpm generate-pokemons
pnpm lint
```

## TODO

[ ] Do something about Pocketbase autocancelation failing. Possibly rewrite how we talk to db?
[ ] Middleware - csp "unsafe-hashes" can be mitigated if there is a way to set relative moouse pisition in a top-level script with a nonce for effects/spotlightCard.tsx.
[ ] Fine tune /thoughts typography, including the hihglight theme
[ ] Rewrite /scripts to use typescipt
[ ] Use vibrant colors for mons instead of the dominant color to improve contrast. Or investigate two colors per mon? That would increase the css filesize tho...
